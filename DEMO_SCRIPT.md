# Rate Derivation Prototype - Demo Script

**Goal:** Demonstrate room creation, rate derivation, supplement configuration, and matrix simulation in 90 seconds.

## 1. Introduction (0:00 - 0:15)
"Hi, allow me to present the new Rate Derivation Prototype. This powerful system enables hotels to manage complex rate strategies with ease, handling parent-child relationships and granular policies."

## 2. Room Configuration (0:15 - 0:25)
*Action: Click 'Room Types', Click 'Add Room Type', enter details.*
"First, we define our inventory structure. Let's add a new Premium Room type to our portfolio."

## 3. Rate Plan & Supplements (0:25 - 0:50)
*Action: Click 'Rate Plans', Click 'Add Rate Plan', enter details.*
"Now, let's configure our pricing strategy. I'll create a new derived rate plan linked to our base rates."

*Action: Scroll down to Room Supplement Configuration Matrix.*
"Scrolling down, we find the Room Supplement Configuration Matrix. Here, we can set specific supplements for each room type."

*Action: Change a fixed value input.*
"I'll adjust this fixed supplement..."

*Action: Change a percentage value input.*
"...and transform this one into a percentage adjustment. This gives us dynamic, flexible pricing power across all room types."

## 4. Policies (0:50 - 1:00)
*Action: Click 'Policies', create policy.*
"We also have a dedicated module for Cancellation Policies, allowing us to enforce strict or flexible rules across the board."

## 5. Matrix Simulation (1:00 - 1:30)
*Action: Click 'Matrix', scroll.*
"Finally, the Daily Rates Matrix brings it all together. This view simulates your real-time distribution."

*Action: Change multiple days.*
"Watch as I update the rates for multiple days. Notice how every derived plan updates instantly?"

*Action: Scroll horizontally to show all plans.*
"This real-time engine ensures your distribution is always accurate, profitable, and easy to manage."
